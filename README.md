## Store Manager

Back-end project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

This was my first __RESTful__ _API_ made using the __MSC__ (model-service-controller) architecture.
This API is a sales management system which is possible to create, read, update and delete (_CRUD_) products and sales.
The databank used to manage data was _MySQL_.
The API also has all of its __MSC__ layers covered with 100% of unit tests using __Mocha__, __Chai__ and __Sinon__.
